**Intercomparison of Lagrangian particle tracking software packages in ROMS**

Lagrangian particle tracking is widely utilized to study transport features in a range of physical, chemical, and biological processes in oceanography. In this study, we officially introduced a new offline particle tracking package, [Tracker](https://github.com/parkermac/LO/tree/main/tracker), and evaluted its performance in comparison to ROMS online dye and online particle tracking ([floats](https://www.myroms.org/wiki/floats.in)), and three offline particle tracking software packages ([LTRANS](https://northweb.hpl.umces.edu/LTRANS.htm), [OpenDrift](https://opendrift.github.io/), [Particulator](https://github.com/neilbanas/particulator)). It was found that both particle and dye approaches give similar results across different model resolutions and domains when they were tracking the same water mass, as indicated by similar mean advection pathways and spatial distributions of dye and particles. The flexibility of offline particle tracking and its similarity against online dye and particle tracking make it a useful tool to complement existing ocean circulation models. The new Tracker was shown to be a reliable particle tracking package to complement ROMS. Lastly, we also explored the tradeoffs of computational efficiency, modifiability, and ease of use that can influence the choice of which package. The main value of the present study is that the different particle and dye tracking codes were all run on the same model output, or within the model that generated the output. This allows some measure of intercomparison of the different tracking schemes.
