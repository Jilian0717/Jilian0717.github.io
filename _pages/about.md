Hi here! I'm a postdoc working with Dr. [Parker MacCready](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/). I'm interested in how does estuarine (or coastal) circulation influences the biology, such as [harmful algal bloom](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10308), [hypoxia](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JC017592), [eDNA](https://www.ednacollab.org/mmarinedna-about).
I'm using realistic numerical models. 

I got my Ph.D. from Virginia Institute of Marine Science, advised by Dr. [Jina Shen](https://www.vims.edu/people/shen_j/index.php).
