Hi there! I'm a postdoc working with Dr. [Parker MacCready](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/). My research mainly focuses on understanding how estuarine and coastal circulations influence biological or biogeochemical processes, such as [harmful algal bloom](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X22008694), [hypoxia](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JC017592), and [eDNAüß¨](https://www.ednacollab.org/mmarinedna-about). To answer "What does physics üåä do to biologyüêü", I use realistic oceanographic numerical models, including [LiveOcean](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/LiveOcean.html) (built based on ROMS), [SCHISM](https://schism-dev.github.io/schism/master/index.html), and EFDC. Besides utilizing the existent numerical model framework, I enjoy making some model developments, such as adding growth and decay processes to numerical particles to represent the life cycle of [algal blooms](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10308). I have experience in working on two large estuarine systems, the Chesapeake Bay and the Salish Sea. In 2022, I got my Ph.D. from Virginia Institute of Marine Science, advised by Dr. [Jian Shen](https://www.vims.edu/people/shen_j/index.php). 

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, jogging, and road trips.
