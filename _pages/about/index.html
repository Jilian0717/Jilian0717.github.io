<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi there! I’m a postdoc working with Dr. <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Parker MacCready</a>. I’m interested in understanding how estuarine and coastal circulations influence biological or biogeochemical processes, such as <a href="https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10308" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">harmful algal bloom</a>, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JC017592" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">hypoxia</a>, and <a href="https://www.ednacollab.org/mmarinedna-about" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">eDNA</a>. To answer “What does physics 🌊 do to biology🐟”, I use realistic oceanographic numerical models, including <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/LiveOcean.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LiveOcean</a> (built based on ROMS), <a href="https://schism-dev.github.io/schism/master/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SCHISM</a>, and EFDC. I have experience in working on two large estuarine systems, the Chesapeake Bay and the Salish Sea. I got my Ph.D. from Virginia Institute of Marine Science, advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.vims.edu/people/shen_j/index.php" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jian Shen</a>.</p> <p>Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, jogging, and road trips.</p> </body></html>
