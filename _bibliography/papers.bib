  abstract={Climate change and nutrient pollution contribute to the expanding global footprint of harmful algal blooms. To better predict their spatial distributions and disentangle biophysical controls, a novel Lagrangian particle tracking and biological (LPT-Bio) model was developed with a high-resolution numerical model and remote sensing. The LPT-Bio model integrates the advantages of Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches by explicitly simulating algal bloom dynamics, algal biomass change, and diel vertical migrations along predicted trajectories. The model successfully captured the intensity and extent of the 2020 Margalefidinium polykrikoides bloom in the lower Chesapeake Bay and resolved fine-scale structures of bloom patchiness, demonstrating a reliable prediction skill for 7–10 d. The fully coupled LPT-Bio model initialized/calibrated by remote sensing and controlled by ambient environmental conditions appeared to be a powerful approach to predicting transport pathways, identifying bloom hotspots, resolving concentration variations at subgrid scales, and investigating responses of HABs to changing environmental conditions and human interference.},

  title={Storm-induced coastward expansion of Margalefidinium polykrikoides bloom in Chesapeake Bay},
  author={Xiong, J. and Shen, J. and Wang, Q.},
  abstract={An unusual coastward expansion of the toxic dinoflagellate species Margalefidinium polykrikoides was observed in 2020 summer after a tropical storm passing Chesapeake Bay. Such coastward expansion was only recorded in 2007. A newly developed coupled Lagrangian particle tracking and harmful algal bloom model driven by environmental variables was used to investigate the underlying mechanisms and successfully reproduced the expansion patterns. Persistent pre-storm southerly winds favored the delivery of bloom source water originated inside the bay to the coast. Storm-induced strong upwelling of denser subsurface water interacted with the after-storm outflow plume (steered southward as the storm's impacts waned), forming a transport barrier to accumulate algae and delineate the coastwide bloom extent. Algal diel vertical migrations and transport barrier enable algae to stay in the nearshore regions. The storm-induced coastward expansion of M. polykrikoides might increase future bloom possibility in the coastal area.},
