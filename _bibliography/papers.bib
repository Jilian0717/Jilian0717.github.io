  title={Intercomparisons of five ocean particle tracking software packages in the Regional Ocean Modeling System},
  author={Xiong, J. and MacCready, P.},
  abstract={Particle tracking is widely utilized to study transport features in a range of physical, chemical, and biological processes in oceanography. In this study, a new offline particle tracking package, Tracker, is introduced and its performance is evaluated in comparison to an online Eulerian dye, one online and three offline particle tracking software packages in a small high-resolution model domain and a large coarser model domain. It was found that both particle and dye approaches give similar results across different model resolutions and domains when they were tracking the same water mass, as indicated by similar mean advection pathways and spatial distributions of dye and particles. The flexibility of offline particle tracking and its similarity against online dye and particle tracking make it a useful tool to complement existing ocean circulation models. The new Tracker was shown to be a reliable particle tracking package to complement the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). Lastly, tradeoffs of computational efficiency, modifiability, and ease of use that can influence the choice of which package to use are explored. The main value of the present study is that the different particle and dye tracking codes were all run on the same model output, or within the model that generated the output. This allows some measure of intercomparison of the different tracking schemes.},

  title={Biophysical interactions control the progression of harmful algal blooms in Chesapeake Bay: a novel Lagrangian particle tracking model with mixotrophic growth and vertical migration},

  abstract={Climate change and nutrient pollution contribute to the expanding global footprint of harmful algal blooms. To better predict their spatial distributions and disentangle biophysical controls, a novel Lagrangian particle tracking and biological (LPT-Bio) model was developed with a high-resolution numerical model and remote sensing. The LPT-Bio model integrates the advantages of Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches by explicitly simulating algal bloom dynamics, algal biomass change, and diel vertical migrations along predicted trajectories. The model successfully captured the intensity and extent of the 2020 Margalefidinium polykrikoides bloom in the lower Chesapeake Bay and resolved fine-scale structures of bloom patchiness, demonstrating a reliable prediction skill for 7–10 d. The fully coupled LPT-Bio model initialized/calibrated by remote sensing and controlled by ambient environmental conditions appeared to be a powerful approach to predicting transport pathways, identifying bloom hotspots, resolving concentration variations at subgrid scales, and investigating responses of HABs to changing environmental conditions and human interference.},

  title={Storm-induced coastward expansion of Margalefidinium polykrikoides bloom in Chesapeake Bay},
  author={Xiong, J. and Shen, J. and Wang, Q.},
  abstract={An unusual coastward expansion of the toxic dinoflagellate species Margalefidinium polykrikoides was observed in 2020 summer after a tropical storm passing Chesapeake Bay. Such coastward expansion was only recorded in 2007. A newly developed coupled Lagrangian particle tracking and harmful algal bloom model driven by environmental variables was used to investigate the underlying mechanisms and successfully reproduced the expansion patterns. Persistent pre-storm southerly winds favored the delivery of bloom source water originated inside the bay to the coast. Storm-induced strong upwelling of denser subsurface water interacted with the after-storm outflow plume (steered southward as the storm's impacts waned), forming a transport barrier to accumulate algae and delineate the coastwide bloom extent. Algal diel vertical migrations and transport barrier enable algae to stay in the nearshore regions. The storm-induced coastward expansion of M. polykrikoides might increase future bloom possibility in the coastal area.},

  title={Vertical Transport Timescale of Surface-Produced Particulate Material in the Chesapeake Bay},
  author={Xiong, J. and Shen, J.},
  abstract={The Chesapeake Bay is a highly productive estuary, characterized by spring phytoplankton blooms and subsequent accumulations of particulate organic matter (POM) in the bottom layer, which fuels summertime hypoxia. The retention time of POM provides an important timescale to interpret biochemical reactions in estuaries. In this study, we applied the vertical particulate age (VPA), the average time elapsed since the POM leaving the surface, to estimate the downward-transport time. The VPA accounts for all possible trajectories, including direct sinking and interactions with the seabed via resuspension and deposition. It was found that the VPA is much longer than the vertical transport time for dissolved material due to the elongated resting of particulates on the seabed and contributions from the resuspended old material. The VPA is sensitive to the settling velocity and increases 2 orders of magnitude with the settling velocity from 0 to 10 m/day in less dynamic environments. The slow-sinking material can remain in suspension while the fast-sinking material mostly stays on the seabed. No significant difference in the VPA was found between wet and dry years except during the episodic freshwater pulse, which brought aged materials from the depositional shoals to increase the VPA in the channel.},

  title={Exchange Flow and Material Transport Along the Salinity Gradient of a Long Estuary},
  author={Xiong, J. and Shen, J. and Qin, Q.},
  abstract={Chesapeake Bay (CB) is the largest estuary in the United States, with a major deep channel indented by a shallow sill in the lower bay. The longitudinal topography of CB can be characterized as “Shallow-Deep-Shallow.” Previous studies in other estuaries addressed the impact of the axial topographic variations on estuarine hydrodynamics yet seldom on material transport and retention, such as the retention time of organic matter, an important indicator for hypoxia issue. This study examines how the particular longitudinal topography affects the transport of salt (from the coastal ocean) and riverine dissolved materials (RDMs, from the river) by using a 32-years numerical model simulation. We find that the shallow sill will obviously increase the retention time of RDMs upstream of the shoal, mainly because the abrupt shoaling near the shoal results in strong mixing and reflux of the surface outflow, associated with the surface velocity convergence and resultant downwelling. Exchange flow (i.e., surface outflow and bottom inflow) and river outflow dominate the transports of salt and RDMs in CB, whereas the contribution from the tidal process is localized near the mouth. It is also found the shallow sill will not block the exchange flow, which increases monotonically toward downstream.},

  title={Water exchange and its relationships with external forcings and residence time in Chesapeake Bay},
  author={Xiong, J. and Shen, J. and Qin, Q. and Du, J.},
  abstract={Water exchange, featured by bottom inflow and surface outflow in a typical estuary, determines the transport and redistribution of salt, nutrients, pollutants, and suspended sediments and organisms. Water exchange in Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the US, has been extensively studied, yet its long-term interannual variability and its relationship with the external forcings are not fully understood. Based on a long-term (1980–2011) numerical model simulation, this study examines the water exchanges between Chesapeake Bay and the adjacent coastal shelf, between different regions within the bay, as well as their relationships with river discharge, wind, and residence time. Through an EOF analysis of the bottom inflow and surface outflow at seven selected cross-bay sections, we found that over 90% of the spatiotemporal variations of water exchange can be explained by the first two EOF modes, which are highly correlated with the freshwater discharge and north- westerly wind, respectively. Unlike the outflow that increases linearly with river discharge as commonly ex- pected, the inflow responds non-monotonically to river discharge. The relationship between the river discharge and inflow can be described by a combination of the Michaelis–Menten/Monod equation and a linearly decreasing function, i.e., the inflow initially increases with river discharge due to enhanced gravitational cir- culation and then levels, and gradually declines due to overwhelming seaward barotropic current. We found a locally enhanced water exchange in the lower-middle bay, which can be attributed to the persistent reflux of surface outflow due to the irregular geometry and rapid shoaling in the channel bathymetry. The water exchange and the mean residence time can be connected reciprocally through the bay volume, yet the validation of this relationship depends on the timescale to be considered since the residence time at a given time is controlled by the future hydrodynamics. A delay effect should be considered when using the relationship to estimate outflow interchangeably with the direct computation of the outflow.},
